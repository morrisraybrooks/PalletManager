I need to create an Android app to help me manage multiple pallet deliveries while operating a forklift at Dollar General. Here's the specific workflow I need to support:

**Current System Limitations:**
- The forklift computer only displays one pallet instruction at a time
- When I accept a new pallet pickup, the screen clears and I lose the previous pallet's destination information
- This makes it difficult to handle multiple pallets efficiently

**Required App Features:**
1. **Pallet Information Storage**: Allow me to manually input and save pallet details including:
   - Product name (e.g., "Gravy Train", "Old Roy")
   - Destination location (format: X-XX-XX-X, e.g., "3-58-15-1")
   - Check digit (e.g., "21", "99")

2. **Multiple Pallet Management**: 
   - Store information for at least 2 pallets simultaneously
   - Display both pallets' information clearly on one screen
   - Allow me to mark pallets as "delivered" when complete

3. **Mobile-Optimized Interface**:
   - Design for Android phone use in a warehouse environment
   - Large, easy-to-tap buttons for use with work gloves
   - Clear, readable text that's visible in various lighting conditions

4. **Simple Workflow**:
   - Quick data entry for new pallet information
   - Easy viewing of all pending deliveries
   - Simple completion/removal of delivered pallets

**Technical Requirements:**
- Android app compatible with standard work phones
- Offline functionality (no internet required during use)
- Simple, intuitive interface suitable for quick use between tasks

The goal is to eliminate the memory burden of tracking multiple pallet destinations when the forklift computer only shows one instruction at a time.



also to get the check digit for the first pallett i have to look it up in my note book is there a way of adding all of the check digits 
to the app for 03-57-1-1 through 03-57-63-1 and 03-58-1-1 through 03-58-63-1
